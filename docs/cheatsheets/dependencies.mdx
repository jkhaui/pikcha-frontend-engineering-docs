# Dependencies

## Installing Dependencies

_Within the `/PikchaWebApp/ClientApp` root directory_:
```shell
> yarn
```

Please remember that **we only use yarn as our package manager!!!**.

**Use of npm is strictly forbidden** (and will throw an error in your
terminal if you try running `npm i`) because mixing of `package-lock.json` and
`yarn.lock` files can cause serious conflicts amongst developers' environments.

## Adding New Dependencies
N.b. Firstly, check the [UI Workflow cheatsheet](./ui-workflow) __to determine
if you should even be adding a new package__.

E.g. Adding the `react-eyedrop` package to the main app:
```shell
> cd packages/app
> yarn add react-eyedrop
```
