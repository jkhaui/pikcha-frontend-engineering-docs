# Managing State

_N.b. As of 06/09/2021, **we will begin the process of deprecating Redux-related
code** to prepare for the transition to Apollo Client as a single data & state
management store._

## Should I be using Redux?
Having a deterministic global state container is excellent, but if we're
being real, Redux can often be more hassle then it's worth. Use this quick
checklist to determine whether to use Redux or local component state.

#### _Does state need to be shared?_
- Yes: consider how many levels props will need to be drilled down.
- No: don't use Redux.

#### _State Persistence_
Is it essential that the state (or some slice of it) is persisted for the
entirety of the browser session?
- Yes: use Redux.
- No: consider other reasons for using Redux. If there isn't any, then
ephemeral state localised to a component (_i.e. `useState();`_) should suffice.

#### _Do You Know How to Use Redux?_
- Yes: then you should know your answer by now.
- No: if you're a backend developer and aren't fully comfortable with Redux
patterns, that's fine. We'd much prefer it if you stick to what you're
comfortable with, such as local state. Consult a frontend dev if you can't
complete your task without involving Redux.
